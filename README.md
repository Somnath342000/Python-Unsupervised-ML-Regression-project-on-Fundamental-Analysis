# Python-Unsupervised-ML-Regression-project-on-Fundamental-Analysis
Hi, Somnath is here, I have developed a ML regression model using VS Code jupiter Notebook platform. I have gathered data from internet &amp; develop this model which is very helpful to pick a stock to buy or not to buy. please go through the code...thanks.
Regression
Goal: Predict a continuous numeric output (real-valued) based on input features.
Algorithms:
Linear Regression: A model that predicts a continuous target variable by fitting a linear relationship to the input features.
Ridge and Lasso Regression: Variants of linear regression that apply regularization to prevent overfitting.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): A type of SVM used for regression tasks.
Decision Trees for Regression: A tree model that predicts continuous values rather than class labels.
Random Forest Regression: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to predict continuous outputs.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): An ensemble learning technique that combines weak learners (typically decision trees) in a sequential manner to improve predictive performance.
Neural Networks for Regression: Deep learning models that can be used for predicting continuous values in more complex tasks.
